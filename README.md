# BreastCancerGBC
This project applies GBC to diagnose breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. GBC is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple weak learners-decision trees one after another, correcting errors in every step to ultimately come up with a more accurate model.
